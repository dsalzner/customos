# Custom OS

Writing a Custom Operating System.

Current Features:

* 32-bit unprotected (Ring 0) basic operating system
* boots with Grub and runs on emulators such as QEmu
* handles keyboard input via interrupts
* can read and write to fat32 disk through a custom built lean PCI- and IDE-driver and the fatfs filesystem libraries
* color graphics with 320x200 pixel and 256-bit colour
* a terminal/shell written in Rust that supports a small command set: list directory (```ls <path>```), read file (```rf <filename>```), ...
* a small C compiler is built-in so functionality can be extended with code written inside of the CustomOS

## Dependencies

The code is inspired by many other public domain CustomOS GitHub repos cited in the blog posts and most notably the guides and examples from the osdev-forums and wiki [1]

## Contributing & Compiling from source

The code can be compiled from source on Linux using the Makefiles. 

For this you will need to first build the custom compile chain by running ``./Pt1-CrossCompiler/gccbuild.sh```.

The ```gccbuild.sh``` script and Makefiles have been tested under Ubuntu 20.04 through 23.10. 

Anyone is welcome to contribute, see [Guide on Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Releases

### 2024-05-30

* added a C-Code compiler so functionality can be extended with code written inside of the CustomOS
* added example applications

known bugs/stability issues:
* editing/running large source code fails due to limitations in file read/write
* filenames longer than 9 chars don't work reliably
* main shell line breaks occasionally slide
* QEmu boot loops on approx. every 10th boot
* there's a considerable amount of compiler warnings during compilation

critical features missing:
* remove/move/copy files functionality
* higher screen resolution

### 2024-05-18

* added a basic text editor application written in Rust to read/write/edit files
* usability improvements for shell scripts and Makefiles
* fixed some bugs

### 2024-05-03

* Code accompanying Blog Posts Pt1 to Pt9
* features: cross-compile toolchain build script, basic kernel, interrupt handled keyboard input, read and write files to disk, graphical terminal written in rust.
